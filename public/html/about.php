            <p>The creation of this application was a collective work of the following students from group A1:
                Martinescu Nicolae, Nastasiu Stefan si Cobaschi Emanuel-Aser. <span id="dots"></span><span id="more">The team was created as a result of a very good friendship and collaboration during the studying years.We managed to build up this software product with the aim of creating an interactive, easy-to-use application that allows an attractive visualization of some data selections based on certain criteria, in the automotive field.
            So, the user can create certain new viewing instances, from the desired categories, based on selected criteria.Also,he has the possibility to export these visualizations in certain familiar formats.
